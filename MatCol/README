The compiled version of MatCol could be used on the Windows platform  without the need for a licensed version of Matlab, 
though, a Matlab runtime would be required which is available freely from Mathworks website (https://au.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr.html).

This latest release was tested in Matlab 2016b. 

matcol.m file is the main GUI run file.

the command line script matcolcli process all images in a specified folder 
and write results in 'results.txt' tab delimited file. 

Examples:
Process a folder with all default parameters.
On Windows:
matcolcli('C:\Users\mkhushi\Downloads\MatCol0.94\samplesimages\');

On Linux/Mac:
matcolcli('/path/images/');

Using all options:
matcolcli('path\samplesimages\','tmr',2, 'tmg', 2, 'medfilt', [3,3],'wiener', [5,5], 'mincommonpixels', 5, 'roi', 1, 'savemask', 1)

tmr             =   Threshold Mutiplier for red channel, default is 2.
tmg             =   Threshold Mutiplier for green channel, default is 2.
medfilt         =   Window for median filter; default is [3,3].
wiener          =   Window for Wiener filter; default is [5,5].
mincommonpixels =   Minimum common pixels that must overlap on the red and green channel to report a colocalisation. Default is 1.
roi             =   Calculate colocalisation for each region of interest (ROI). 
savemask        =   Automatic ROI is marked from the blue channel. 
                    Setting this option will save this mask to disk.
                    Each ROI is labelled with a sequential number with information about
                    total red & green spots and total number of overlap (colocalisation) found are also writen on the mask image.

# Wavelet Denoised-ResNet CNN and LightGBM Method to Predict Forex Rate of Change #

## There are three parts in the project ##


1. DataProcessing is about how to deal with the dataset

2. Prediction is about the predict method for the forex change rate

3. Dataset is the USDJPY 5M dataset from 2004.1.1 to 2020.6.9

Instruction:

1. In the dataset there is a large USDJPY M5 dataset from 2004.1.1 to 2020.6.9,in the paper,I used the dataset from 2019.1.1 to 2020.6.9

2. Run the DataProcessing.py which include the wavelet denoise method and caculation of technical indicators to process the data

3. Run the prediction.ipynb block by block

4. If you want to modify the code,you can follow the comments in the ipynb
